Lake water quality data from
https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/modelled-lake-water-quality/


Need to answer this. Do explanation of where data from, what each variable means...................
I expect a mostly textual description of the data set: what is is about, where did you find it, what's your motivation, its availability. A initial guiding question, based on what you've learned from looking at the data set would be interesting, even if very broad at this stage.
