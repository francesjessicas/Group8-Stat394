Need to answer this. Do explanation of where data from, what each variable means...................
I expect a mostly textual description of the data set: what is is about, where did you find it, what's your motivation, its availability. A initial guiding question, based on what you've learned from looking at the data set would be interesting, even if very broad at this stage.



The data contains modelled median values for 




We have edited this data slightly. Previously, Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Chlorophyll-a, Total nitrogen, Total phosphorus, Water clarity and Trophic level index were categories in a variable called 'measure', and the values for each were all recorded in a variable called 'median'. We wanted to be able to compare levels of some of these variables to see if there was a relationship between any pairs. To be able to do this, we made a new variable for each measure, with their values recorded in their own variables, along with some categorical variables indicating the band classification and whether the observation exceeded the national bottom line for that measure (if there is one). In this new set of data, each lake has a single observation, as opposed to the six or more each had before the data was truncated. No observations were changed
