# Textual Description of the Dataset
Our dataset contains information from 3801 lakes in New Zealand.   
  
This dataset which, we refer to as the lakes dataset, was extracted from Stats NZ.
https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/modelled-lake-water-quality/

## Variables
For analysis we split the dataset into two main categories:
- The Lake Health Variables
- The Lake Dimension Variables

The Lake Health Variables measure as a whole give an indication of the "health" of an individual lake. The five lake health variables are Clarity (SECCHI), Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Total phosphorus, and Chlorophyll a. A high value in any of these variables is an indicator of possible poor lake health (with the exception of clarity where a lower value is an indicator of poor lake health).  
  
The Lake Dimension Variables measure the dimesnions of the lake. The three Lake Dimension Variables are Lake Depth, Lake Area, Lake Perimeter.

Additional variables that we examined were:
- Region; which New Zealand Region the lake was located in.
- Dominant Landcover; split into Exotic Forest, Native, Pastoral, Urban Area and Other, Dominant Lancover describes the landscape surrounding the lake.
