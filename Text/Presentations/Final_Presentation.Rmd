# Textual Description of the Dataset
Our dataset contains information from 3801 lakes in New Zealand. This dataset was extracted from Stats NZ.
https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/modelled-lake-water-quality/  

## Variables

For analysis we split the dataset into two main categories; the lake health variables and the lake dimension variable. The lake health variables measure as a whole give an indication of the "health" of an individual lake. The five lake health variables are Clarity, Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Total phosphorus, and Chlorophyll-A. A high value in any of these variables is an indicator of possible poor lake health (with the exception of clarity where a lower value is an indicator of poor lake health). The lake dimension variables measure the dimensions of the lake. The three lake dimension variables are depth, area, perimeter. Additional variables that we examined were:  
- Region; which New Zealand region the lake was located in.  
- Dominant landcover; split into Exotic Forest, Native, Pastoral, Urban Area and Other, Dominant landcover describes the landscape surrounding the lake. 

## Exploratory Data Analysis












Perform an EDA of the variables that we grouped together. At this point in time, we did not have a specific leading question that we were interested in. As such, we thought it would be prudent to make the goal of our EDA to extract as much interesting information from our data as  we could; then use the results to come up with leading questions.

Once the EDA was performed we came up with some interesting questions that we could investigate further for the Preliminary Report. WE then conducted more analyses. The results of this were then refined.
The results of these were then refined into our Final Report.
