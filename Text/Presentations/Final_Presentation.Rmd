# Textual Description of the Dataset  
Our dataset contains information from 3801 lakes in New Zealand. This dataset was extracted from Stats NZ.
https://www.stats.govt.nz/indicators/modelled-lake-water-quality/  

## Variables  

For analysis we split the dataset into two main categories; the lake health variables and the lake dimension variables. The lake health variables measure as a whole give an indication of the "health" of an individual lake. The five lake health variables are Clarity, Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Total Nitrogen, Total phosphorus, and Chlorophyll-A. Additional variables that we examined were:  
- The lake dimension variables measure the dimensions of the lake. The three lake dimension variables are depth, area, perimeter.  
- Region; which New Zealand region the lake was located in, and  
- Dominant landcover; split into five types; Exotic Forest, Native, Pastoral, Urban area and other.  

# Lake Health Variables

*Ammoniacal Nitrogen* is a form of nitrogen that supports algae and plant growth, but in large concentrations can be toxic to aquatic life. 
  
*Chlorophyll-a* is an organic molecule found in plant cells that allows plants to photosynthesize. The variable Chlorophyll-a is a measure of the concentration of phytoplankton biomass in milligrams per cubic metre. High concentrations of chlorophyll is a symptom of degraded water quality.  

*Total Phosphorus* is the sum of all phosphorus forms in the water. Large amounts of phosphorus in lakes can reduce dissolved oxygen in the water. This can cause low oxygen areas in the lake, where some aquatic life cannot survive.   

*Total Nitrogen* is the sum of all nitrogens found in the water. An excess of nitrogen in lakes can cause an increase in algae and plant growth, possibly depriving the lake of oxygen.  
  
*Clarity* is measured in Secchi depth. This is the maximum depth (in metres) a black and white Secchi disk is visible from the surface of the lake.  
  







# Exploratory Data Analysis

First we analysed the distribution of the lake health variables. Figure \ref{fig:correlationplot} shows the visualisation of the correlation matrix for the lake health variables.

lake <- read.csv("../../Data/modelled_lake_water_quality_altered.csv")

```


```{r correlationplot, fig.cap="Visualisation of the Correlation Matrix", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", fig.pos="center", echo=FALSE, warning = FALSE}

df11 <- data.frame(Ammoniacal_Nitrogen, Chlorophyll_A, Total_Phosphorus, Total_Nitrogen, Clarity)
ggcorrplot(cor(df11), method = "circle", hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower")
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Next, we wanted to compare the distribution of the lake health variables by types of dominant landcover. The side-by-side boxplots are shown in figure \ref{fig:boxx3}.  


```{r boxx3, fig.cap="Box Plots of Ammoniacal Nitrogen,  Chlorophyll-A, Total Phosphorus, Total Nitrogen and Clarity by Landcover", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", notch=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

region <- as.factor(lake$region)
land <- as.factor(lake$dominant_landcover)
Ammoniacal_Nitrogen <- lake$median_NH4N_mg.L..1
Chlorophyll_A <- lake$median_CHLA_mg.m.3
Total_Phosphorus <- lake$median_TP_mg.m.3
Total_Nitrogen <- lake$median_TN_mg.m.3
Clarity <- lake$median_SECCHI_metre

df12 <- data.frame(land, Ammoniacal_Nitrogen, Chlorophyll_A, Total_Phosphorus, Total_Nitrogen, Clarity)
df12melt <- melt(df12,id.vars = "land" ,variable.name = "Measure")
ggplot(df12melt, aes(x=Measure, y=value)) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(col=Measure), notch = TRUE) +
  facet_grid(~ land) +
  scale_y_log10() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), legend.position = "bottom")+
  theme_tufte()
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The pairs plot of the lake health and dimension variables, coloured by dominant landcover, is shown in figure \ref{fig:pairsplot}.  

```{r pairsplot, fig.cap="Pairs Plot", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", fig.pos="center", echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
ggpairs(df11, aes(col=land, alpha=.5))
```




# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, echo = FALSE}
####Creating a dataset with the health variables and region
Region <- lake$region
df.Health_Region<-cbind(df1, Region)
```




Next we wanted to investigate which regions in particular had the worst median lake health. We constructed the following tables, with Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Chlorophyll-A, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen ordered in descending medians, and Clarity ordered in ascending medians. 

```{r an, echo = FALSE}

NH4N_mean<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(NH4N), list(Mean_NH4N = mean))
NH4N_mean<-NH4N_mean[-1,]


NH4N_median<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(NH4N), list(Median_NH4N = median))
NH4N_median <- NH4N_median[-1,]


NH4N_region <- cbind(NH4N_mean, NH4N_median[,-1])

taba <- NH4N_region %>% arrange(desc(Mean_NH4N))
```
  

```{r c, echo = FALSE}

CHLA_mean<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(CHLA), list(Mean_CHLA = mean))
CHLA_mean<-CHLA_mean[-1,]


CHLA_median<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(CHLA), list(Median_CHLA = median))
CHLA_median <- CHLA_median[-1,]


CHLA_region <- cbind(CHLA_mean, CHLA_median[,-1])

tabc <- CHLA_region %>% arrange(desc(Median_CHLA))

```



```{r tp, echo = FALSE}

TP_mean<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(TP), list(Mean_TP = mean))
TP_mean<-TP_mean[-1,]


TP_median<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(TP), list(Median_TP = median))
TP_median <- TP_median[-1,]


TP_region <- cbind(TP_mean, TP_median[,-1])

tabp <- TP_region %>% arrange(desc(Median_TP))

```
 

```{r tn, echo = FALSE}


TN_mean<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(TN), list(Mean_TN = mean))
TN_mean<-TN_mean[-1,]


TN_median<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(TN), list(Median_TN = median))
TN_median <- TN_median[-1,]


TN_region <- cbind(TN_mean, TN_median[,-1])

tabn <- TN_region %>% arrange(desc(Median_TN))


```
 
 

```{r sec, out.width = "20%", out.height = "20%", message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
SECCHI_mean<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(SECCHI), list(Mean_SECCHI = mean))
SECCHI_mean<-SECCHI_mean[-1,]


SECCHI_median<-df.Health_Region %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(SECCHI), list(Median_SECCHI = median))
SECCHI_median <- SECCHI_median[-1,]


SECCHI_region <- cbind(SECCHI_mean, SECCHI_median[,-1])

tabs <- SECCHI_region %>% arrange(Median_SECCHI)
tab1 <- cbind(taba, tabc, tabp)
tab2 <- cbind(tabn, tabs)
knitr::kable(tab1, caption = "Regional Mean and Median Lake Health", format="latex") %>% kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

Below is the tables for the regional means and medians of Total Nitrogen and Clarity.

```{r tab2, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
knitr::kable(tab2, caption = "Regional Mean and Median Lake Health", format="latex") %>% kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
```






# Exploratory Data Analysis

We also looked into the relationship between the dimension variables and region, shown in figure \ref{fig:dimensions}.

```{r dimensions, fig.cap = "Bar Graphs of Lake Dimensions by Region", out.width = "100%", out.height = "60%",  echo = FALSE}
LakeTable <-filter(lake, !region == "") %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(lake_depth), list(mean = mean))
LakeTable1<- data.frame(LakeTable)
LakeTable <-filter(lake, !region == "") %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(lake_area), list(mean = mean))
LakeTable2<- data.frame(LakeTable)
LakeTable <-filter(lake, !region == "") %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise_at(vars(lake_perimeter), list(mean = mean))
LakeTable3<- data.frame(LakeTable)
p <- ggplot(data=LakeTable1, aes(x=region, y=mean)) +
  geom_bar(color = "lightblue", fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7, stat="identity")+
  labs(y = "Mean Lake Depth in metres", title = 
         "Mean Lake Depth of Region in metres")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_tufte()
q <- ggplot(data=LakeTable2, aes(x=region, y=mean)) +
  geom_bar(color = "lightblue", fill = "lightblue", alpha = 0.7, stat="identity")+

         "Mean Lake Perimeter of Region in metres")+
  coord_flip()+
  theme_tufte()
grid.arrange(p, q, r, ncol=3)
```


# Exploratory Data Analysis

Figure \ref{fig:pairhd} shows the pairs plot of the lake health variables by the lake dimension variables. 

```{r pairhd, fig.cap = "Pairs Plot of Lake Health Variables by Lake Dimension Variables", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", echo = FALSE}
p <- df3 %>% ggpairs(.,
               title = "A Nice Plot Using ggpairs", 
               mapping = ggplot2::aes(colour=land), 
               diag = list(discrete="barDiag", 
                           continuous = wrap("densityDiag", alpha=0.5 )), 
               upper = list(combo = wrap("box_no_facet", alpha=0.5),
                            continuous = wrap("cor", size=4, alignPercent=0.8))) + 
               theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank()) 
              

plots <- apply(expand.grid(i=7:9, j=2:6), 1, function(ij) getPlot(p, i=ij[1], j=ij[2]))
ggmatrix(plots,
         byrow=FALSE,
         nrow = 3,
         ncol=5,
         xAxisLabels = c("Ammoniacal Nitrogen", "Chlorophyll-A", "Total Phosphorus", "Total Nitrogen", "Clarity"),

```





# Leading Question

Our leading question was; What are some statistics that we can produce that may be beneficial for informing restorative actions that improve the health of lakes in New Zealand?  

To investigate this we came up with the following questions;  

- Are there any particular regions that have poor lake health?  

- Do the lake health variables predict one another?  

- How can we model the lake dimension variables?  

- Do any types of dominant landcover have poorer lake health than others?


# Tools We Applied

In further analysis of these questions we applied the following tools;

- Cullen and Frey graphs  

- Kruskal-Wallis tests with pairwise Wilcox tests

- Principal Component Analysis  

- Factor analysis  

- Linear discriminant analysis

# Cullen and Frey

We used Cullen and Frey graphs on the lake health variables to try to determine what distribution they follow. An example for Ammoniacal Nitrogen is shown below in figure \ref{fig:cfNH4N}.

```{r cfNH4N, fig.cap = "Cullen and Frey Graph of Ammoniacal Nitrogen", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", echo = FALSE}
descdist(NH4N, boot = 1000)
```

# Kruskal-Wallis and Pairwise Wilcox Tests

We conducted Kruskal-Wallis tests for each lake health variable to determine whether there is a difference in those measures between types of dominant landcover. Following this, we conducted pairwise Wilcox tests. An example for clarity is shown below. 

```{r krsecchi, out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", echo = FALSE}
kruskal.test(SECCHI ~ land, data = df2)
pairwise.wilcox.test(SECCHI, land,
                 p.adjust.method = "BH")
```


# Principal Component Analysis

We use Principal Component Analysis to try to simplify the complexity of the Lake Health variables, without losing trends and patterns. The summary of this analysis is shown below. 

```{r scr, fig.cap = "Scree Graph", echo = FALSE}
PCA <- prcomp(df1, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)
```



```{r sum, echo = FALSE}
summary(PCA)
```


# Factor Analysis

We conducted a factor analysis on the lake health variables with the null hypothesis that two factors is sufficient to capture the full dimensionality of the lake health variables. The output of this test showed a chi-square test statistic of 65.57 on one degree of freedom and a p-value of less than 0.0001. 



# Linear Discriminant Analysis

We performed a Linear Discriminant Analysis on the Lake Health variables, to try make a partition to determine the type of dominant landcover, from the Lake Health variables. The model had about 73% accuracy. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
lake3 <- dplyr::select(lake, dominant_landcover, median_TN_mg.m.3, median_CHLA_mg.m.3, median_SECCHI_metre, median_TP_mg.m.3, median_NH4N_mg.L..1)
lake4 <- filter(lake3, dominant_landcover == "Pastoral" | dominant_landcover == "Native")

lake3[2:6] <- scale(lake3[2:6])

set.seed(123)
sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(lake3), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7,0.3))

train <- lake3[sample, ]
test <- lake3[!sample, ]

model1 <- lda(dominant_landcover~., data=train)
```
We found that Pastoral Landcover and Native Landcover each explain about 46% of the prior probabilities. We then produced a partition plot to examine the separation.


```{r, fig.cap = "Partition Plot", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", echo = FALSE}
lake3$dominant_landcover<- as.factor(lake3$dominant_landcover)
partimat(dominant_landcover ~ ., data=lake3, method="lda")

```

  
  
# Linear Discriminant Analysis

We decided to investigate just the Pastoral and Native classes as they accounted for about 93% of the observations in our sample so we produced a second partition plot with just these two classes. The accuracy was only slightly better at 76.7%.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

lake4[2:6] <- scale(lake4[2:6])

set.seed(123)
sample <- sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), nrow(lake4), replace=TRUE, prob=c(0.7,0.3))

train <- lake4[sample, ]
test <- lake4[!sample, ]


lake4$dominant_landcover<- as.factor(lake4$dominant_landcover)

model <- lda(dominant_landcover~., data=train)

predicted <- predict(model, test)


lake5 <- sample(lake4, size = 100, replace = TRUE )
```

```{r, fig.cap = "Partition Plot", out.width = "80%", out.height = "60%", echo = FALSE}
lake4$dominant_landcover<- as.factor(lake4$dominant_landcover)
partimat(dominant_landcover ~ ., data=lake4, method="lda")

```

# Problems

The dataset contained 12 lakes with no entry for dominant land cover. However in the description of the dataset by Stats NZ, it states all lakes have been categorised, and indicated these empty entries should be another category called 'other' that includes 'Gorse and/or Broom', 'Surface mines and dumps', 'Mixed exotic shrubland', and 'Transport infrastructure' so we have assigned these to the 'other' category.  

We also found one lake with no entry for region so we excluded this observation when analysing region with the lake health or dimension variables further.  

We wanted to conduct many more tests, such as ANOVA, which requires normally distributed data. However, our data was not normally distributed, so we used slightly different tests without the normality assumption.  

We also tried to model relationships between the Lake Health variables using a linear model, however many of these relationships were not linear.  

# Conclusions

After our analysis, we can conclude the following:  

- Waikato in particular, had higher levels of Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Chlorophyll-A, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen than other regions, and the lakes in Waikato tended to be murkier than many other regions.  

- We could not come up with a model for the Lake Health or Lake Dimension variables so we cannot determine whether the Lake Health variables predict one another.  

- Lake with predominantly Native landcover tended to have lower levels of Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Chlorophyll-A, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen and be clearer than other landcover types, while Pastoral and Urban tended to have higher levels of Ammoniacal Nitrogen, Chlorophyll-A, Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen and were more murky.  

# Conclusion

Finally, after investigating Lake Health, Dimension, Region and Dominant Landcover, we concluded that, while lakes in the Waikato region tended to have poorer lake health than other regions, they tended to have a larger area, which could mean these lakes require more resources to treat. We noticed the lakes in the South Island tended to be healthier than lakes in the North Island, so we would recommend focusing resources to improve the health of New Zealand lakes to the North Island, in particular, in Waikato.
